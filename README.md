Icon Context Menus
========================

Motivation
-------------

Context Menus have been around a long time (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_menu#History).

In almost all systems, they are implemented as an ordered list of (at most)

    (icon, text)
    (seperator)

This is ripe for re-evaluation.  First-person shooters demonstrate the power of using
icons instead of text.

Other problems with text menus:

*   localization.
*   text isn't always clear about what is going to happen
*   text menus can be hard to click on mobile... "poking a sausage"
*   text menus use lots of space.


We can solve this by allowing HTML into right-click menus.
